# gh-pages-templates

A registry of ready-to-deploy **GitHub Pages** starter templates, with a
browsable gallery — **live previews included** — that deploys itself to Pages.

Each template ships the current official GitHub Actions Pages workflow and the
correct **base-path** setup, so it deploys correctly to a user site (`/`) or a
project site (`/repo/`) with no fiddling.

> Browse the gallery: **https://jongio.github.io/gh-pages-templates/** *(after
> the first deploy — see [Deploy the site](#deploy-the-site))*.

## Templates

| Template | Use it for | Base path | Build |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `static-html` | landing pages, a few hand-made pages | relative URLs (immune) | none |
| `astro` | content sites, blogs, docs, marketing | `base` in `astro.config.mjs` | `astro build` |
| `react-vite` | interactive SPAs / dashboards | `base` + `404.html` fallback | `vite build` |
| `eleventy` | data/Markdown-driven sites | `pathPrefix` via env + `url` filter | `eleventy` |
| `jekyll` | GitHub-native / existing Jekyll | `baseurl` in `_config.yml` | Jekyll |

All deploy via the GitHub Actions Pages source using the current first-party
actions (`configure-pages@v5` → `upload-pages-artifact@v3` → `deploy-pages@v4`;
Astro/Jekyll use their official actions). No `gh-pages` branch.

## Use a template

**With the Copilot skill** (recommended) — install
[`create-gh-pages-site`](https://github.com/jongio/skills/tree/main/skills/create-gh-pages-site)
and describe the site you want; it scaffolds from this registry:

```
/create-gh-pages-site an Astro blog for octocat/blog
```

**With the generator** — directly from a clone of this repo:

```sh
node scripts/new-site.mjs astro --repo octocat/blog --site-name "Octocat's Blog"
```

…or from anywhere, pointing at this registry (needs git + access):

```sh
node scripts/new-site.mjs astro --repo octocat/blog --registry jongio/gh-pages-templates
```

Then push to `main` and set **Settings → Pages → Source → GitHub Actions**.

## The site + live previews

The site lives in **`site/`** — a single, committed source folder you edit directly:
`index.html`, `assets/`, and `templates.json` (the catalog). It uses relative links,
so it's base-path-proof and you can open it as-is.

The only build artifact is the **live previews**. `scripts/build-site.mjs` stamps
each template through the generator at the preview base path, builds it, and writes
the result into **`site/preview/<name>/`** — which is **gitignored**. You never
commit build output; CI rebuilds the previews on every deploy.

```sh
# Build the previews into site/preview (Jekyll needs Ruby), then serve:
node scripts/build-site.mjs
npx serve site
```

Set `PAGES_BASE` to preview at a non-root base (CI does this automatically):

```sh
PAGES_BASE="/gh-pages-templates/" node scripts/build-site.mjs
```

When you add or edit a template manifest, regenerate the committed catalog:

```sh
node scripts/build-catalog.mjs   # writes site/templates.json
```

## Deploy the site

This repo deploys its own site to GitHub Pages:

1. Push to `main`.
2. **Settings → Pages → Source → GitHub Actions**.
3. `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` checks out `site/`, builds the live previews into
   `site/preview/` (Ruby is set up for the Jekyll preview), and publishes `site/`.
   The live URL appears in the Actions run.

## Validate / contribute

```sh
node scripts/validate.mjs   # manifests + workflows + generator stamp checks
```

Add a template by dropping a folder under `templates/<name>/` with a
`template.json` manifest, a `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`, and base-path handling
via the generator's sentinels — see [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md). CI
(`validate.yml`) gates every PR.

## Layout

```
templates/<name>/          Registry source (with __SENTINEL__ placeholders)
  template.json            Manifest (site catalog + generator read this)
  .github/workflows/deploy.yml
site/                      The site — committed source you edit + deploy
  index.html  assets/      Browse UI (static, base-path-proof)
  templates.json           Catalog (generated from manifests by build-catalog.mjs)
  preview/                 Live template previews (gitignored; built by build-site.mjs)
scripts/
  new-site.mjs             Generator — stamp a site, inject the base path
  build-catalog.mjs        Write site/templates.json from manifests
  build-site.mjs           Build live previews into site/preview/
  validate.mjs             CI gate (manifests + workflows + stamp + catalog sync)
.github/workflows/
  deploy.yml               Build previews + deploy site/ to Pages
  validate.yml             Validate templates on push/PR
```
